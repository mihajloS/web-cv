        Most of my carrier I have been working on realtime chat servers in nodejs.

        simple portfolio and then from time to time to introduce new fancy features.
        List of new features is waiting to be published, hold on :) In the mean time you can
        contact me on <a routerLink="/contact">contact page</a>.
